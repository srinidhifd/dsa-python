# time and space complexity 

# time complexity - how much time taken to execute as input increases , not dependednt on execution time on machine 

# best case - Omega notation  O(1)
# worst case - Big O notation O(n)
# average case - Theta notation 

# for i in range(n):
#   for j in range(n): 
#complexity will be n*n = n2


# space complexity - how much memory is required to execute the code
